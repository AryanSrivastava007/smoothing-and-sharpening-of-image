Project Title: Smoothing and Sharpening of Image

Overview
This project aims to provide an implementation for smoothing and sharpening of images using various techniques in image processing. Smoothing and sharpening are fundamental operations in image processing used to enhance or remove noise from images, resulting in clearer and more visually appealing images.

Features
Smoothing Techniques: Implementations of various smoothing techniques such as Gaussian smoothing, median filtering, and bilateral filtering.
Sharpening Techniques: Implementations of sharpening techniques including Laplacian sharpening, unsharp masking, and high-pass filtering.
Customizable Parameters: Allow users to adjust parameters such as filter size, sigma value, and threshold to achieve desired smoothing or sharpening effects.
Image Visualization: Provide functions to visualize the effects of different smoothing and sharpening techniques on input images.
Easy Integration: Simple and easy-to-use APIs for integrating the smoothing and sharpening functionalities into existing projects.
